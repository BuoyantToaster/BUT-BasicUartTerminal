# BUT-BasicUartTerminal
This is a simple UART Terminal program written in Pico Mite Basic.
I made and Tested it on the Clockworkpi Pico Calc kit since I thought it would be useful to be able to use it as a handy little UART Terminal to hook up to other MCUs or SBCs.

So far, it still is a work in progress since its 'menu' if you can even call it that yet, doesn't work the way I would want and so far it also only supports 9600 baud and 115200 baud.
The most usefull ones for MCUs and SBCs (from my experience at least) but I would like to add other options as well in the future.
