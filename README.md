# BUT-BasicUartTerminal
This is a simple UART Terminal program written in Pico Mite Basic.
I made and Tested it on the Clockworkpi Pico Calc kit since I thought it would be useful to be able to use it as a handy little UART Terminal to hook up to other MCUs or SBCs.

Version 1.0 has been uploaded, it is a lot more useful then the alpha version. I added 4 more baud rates and a simple menu that allows one to see all options and scroll through them instead of typing letters for each baud rate.

How ever, handling of transmitted text is still a bit clunky since I didn't change anything of that. But I think that will probably be the next update.
